# Lancer Alternative Structure - GM Colton

This module implements GM Colton's alternate Structure damage table for Lancer.

If a Structure damage check would normally cause a mech to be Stunned, it is instead Jammed.
If a Structure damage check would normally destroy a mech, it is instead Stunned and must roll on the System Trauma result.
When a mech falls to 0 Structure, it is destroyed as usual.

This is a straight replacement for the structure rolling code in the basic system, and should work without the need for additional configuration.
